# T_c CGCNN

## Roadmap

- take Yunwei's 50 known BCS superconductors and 50 known non-superconductors plus the roughly 7000 unlabelled structures from materials project
- build a binary classifier from the labelled materials
- and then train the model with self-supervised mixmatch using the unlabelled structures
